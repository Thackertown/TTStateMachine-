State Machine for Unity: Interface-Driven and Highly Flexible
Introducing a remarkably simple yet powerful state machine for Unity, designed to bring flexibility and ease to your game development process. This state machine stands out with its interface-driven architecture, allowing virtually any class to be transformed into a state or state object. Its minimal footprint and straightforward approach make it an ideal choice for projects of all sizes.

Key Features:
Interface-Driven Design: At the heart of this state machine is an interface-based approach. By implementing a specific interface, any class can be effortlessly turned into a state, enabling seamless integration and extension.

Turn Classes into States or State Objects: With the flexibility to convert classes into states or state objects, this state machine offers unparalleled versatility. Whether you're managing simple states or complex state objects, the transition is smooth and intuitive.

Nested States Capability: Unique to our state machine is the ability to nest states within states. This means states can act as state objects, allowing for sophisticated state hierarchies and dynamic state management.

MonoBehaviour Support: Recognizing the importance of MonoBehaviour in Unity, our state machine includes specialized code to support MonoBehaviour classes. This ensures smooth integration with Unity's component-based architecture and lifecycle.

Lightweight and Uncomplicated: Designed with simplicity in mind, the state machine is compact and easy to understand. It avoids unnecessary complexity, making it accessible to both novice and experienced developers.

Enhanced Game Logic Flow: By structuring game logic through states and state objects, developers can achieve a more organized, maintainable, and scalable codebase. This structure brings clarity to game logic and eases debugging and testing processes.

Ideal Use-Cases:
Gameplay Mechanics: Perfect for handling various gameplay states like menu, pause, gameplay, etc.
Character Behaviors: Manage different character states like idle, walk, jump, attack seamlessly.
UI Flow: Control UI screens and transitions smoothly using state-driven logic.
Getting Started:
To start using this state machine, simply implement the state interface in your class and define the essential methods like Enter, Exit, and Update. Integration is straightforward, with minimal setup required to incorporate it into your existing Unity project.

This state machine is a testament to the power of simplicity and flexibility in game development. Whether you're building a small indie game or a large-scale project, this state machine is designed to streamline your development process and enhance the organization of your game's logic.
